# Diagrams in Markdown

We have two recipes to diplay your diagrams in markdown:

- Using Draw.io
- Using Mermaid

## Draw.io

[Draw.io](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) extension allows you to create, edit, and display your diagrams without leaving your Visual Studio Code. The `.drawio.svg` or `.drawio.png` files can be automatically embedded and displayed in your content, no export needed. FYI, the diagram below was made using Draw.io! You can check the diagram [here](./assets/images/diagram-drawio-demo.drawio.svg).

### Using Draw.io

1. Install [Draw.io](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) VS Code extension.
2. Create a new `*.drawio.svg` or `*.drawio.png` file.
3. Start drawing your diagram. Once you done, save it.
4. Embed the diagram file as you embedding the image file, for example: `![My Diagram](my-diagram.drawio.svg)`

## Mermaid

You can use [Mermaid](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid) plugin to draw and preview diagrams in your content.

⚠️ Be aware that Mermaid diagrams don't automatically get rendered in published Foams in [[github-pages]], and would require you to eject to another static site generation approach that supports Mermaid plugins.
